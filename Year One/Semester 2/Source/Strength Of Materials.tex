\section{Introduction}
    The office hour is Tuesday 14:00 to 15:00 in C217 Engineering Central. \\
    \\
    This module is the study of how materials can sustain external actions without failure by using simplified mathematical models. Types of actions are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Forces
        \item Temperatures changes
        \item Settlements
    \end{itemize}
    While failure types include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rupture
        \item Excessive deformation
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Assessment}
        80\% is a closed book exam at the end of the term. It is a core module, so must acieve at least 40\% in the exam. //
        20\% is based off of three blackboard tests; basic concepts (7\%), Basic beam theory (7\%), Stresses and strains and advanced beam theory (6\%). \\
        You will have one week exactly for each test, they will go live at 16:30 on a friday.

    \subsection{Recommended Reading}

\section{Basic Concepts}
    \subsection{Governing Principles}
        How a load is transmitted through a material is goverened by two basic principles. 
        \subsubsection{Equilibrium}
            The sum of all forces and moments on a body, or any part of a body, must sum to zero. If a problem can be solved using only equilibrium conditions then it is statically determinate.

        \subsubsection{Compatibiblity}
            The movements resulting from the external loads must be internally compatible (the material must not break from movement caused by external loads) when also considering the external supports.

    \subsection{St. Venant's Principle}
        Regardless of the complexity of the distribution of external forces at a small region on the surface of a body, the resulting effect a small distance away depends only on the statically equivalent force. \\
        Results in stress concentrations in a material, rather than uniform stress distribution. \\

    \subsection{Forces}
        Stress is the amount of internal force per unit area:
        \[\sigma = \frac{F}{A}\]
        and can be either tensile or compressive. \\
        \\
        The force acting on an area can be normal or tangentail to the area. The direct stress ($\sigma"$) is the normal force per unit area, while shear stress ($\tau$) is the tangential force per unit area.
