    Polar vectors can use base axis as angle or take an angle relative to a previous point. \\
    Left hand axis z-axis is facing away from you, right hand is facing towards. \\ 
    body is rotating with angular velocity $\vec{\omega}=[\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z]$. Find its velocity at the point $\vec{r}=[x,y,z]$. \\
    The point is rotating along a circle with radius $\rho=rsin\theta$. \\

\section{3D Vectors and Operations}
    \subsection{Cross Product}
        $\abs{a\times b} = \abs{a}\abs{b}sin\theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between $a$ and $b$ \\
        \\
        Cross product of vectors is equivalent to cross product of matrices as you can write vectors as matrices.

    \subsection{Scalar Triple Product}
        Acalar triple product is scalar quantity defined as $a\cdot(b\times c)$. It represents calculating the determinant.
        \[
            a\cdot(b\times c)=(a_xi+a_yj+a_zk)\cdot\begin{vmatrix}
            i&j&k \\
            b_x&b_y&b_z \\
            c_x&c_y&c_z
        \end{vmatrix}
        \]
